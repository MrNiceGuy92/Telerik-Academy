Problem 11 (Popular Programming Languages)

The five most popular programming languages are the following:
	
	1. Java
	2. C
	3. C++
	4. C#
	5. Python
	
Java: There are around nine million developers who use this language worldwide. Its syntax is similar to C and C++, but 
it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. It is an object-oriented language, which can run on more than one platform
without needing to be recompiled.

C: This language lays the foundation for many other languages which have borrowed control structures and other basic features
form C. Such languages include- C#, Limbo, JavaScript, Perl, PHP and many others. C was developed at Bell labs.

C++: This language is biased towards embedded systems and operating system kernels, but can be used for entertainment
software, servers, desktop applications and performance-critical applications.

C#: This language is developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative. C Sharp is a simple, modern, object-oriented programming
language, designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).

Python: This is a high-level programming language. It is an easy to learn language due to its syntax, which allows programmers 
to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
