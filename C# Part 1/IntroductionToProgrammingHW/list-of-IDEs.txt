Problem 12 (Integrated Development Environments)

1. Visual Studio: This IDE is used to develop web sites, web applications and web services as well as computer programs. 
It uses Microsoft development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows 
Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It supports different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support 
nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists.

2. Netbeans: This  Integrated Development Environment is developed by Oracle Corp. primarily with Java. It runs on Windows, 
OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. Eclipse: This IDE is quite comprehensive and even similar to Netbeans in a variety of ways, including its use of Java and plug-in 
architecture. However, Eclipse as an IDE comes in a wild variety of flavours, catering to various needs and objectives in software 
development work flows.

4. Code::Blocks: Unlike the other products seen thus far, Code::Blocks, which is built on the wxWidgets framework, is exceptionally 
lightweight in size, yet still quite functional and feature-rich IDE.

5. SharpDevelop: SharpDevelop is a free and open-source IDE for the .NET Framework. It was designed as a free and lightweight alternative 
to Microsoft Visual Studio, and contains an equivalent feature for almost every essential Visual Studio Express feature, including features for 
project management, code editing, application compiling and debugging.
