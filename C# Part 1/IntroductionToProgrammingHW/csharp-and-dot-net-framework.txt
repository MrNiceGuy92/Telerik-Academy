Problem 13 (Difference between C# and .NET Framework)

C Sharp is an multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft for the .NET Framework. 
It is a very modern, extremely powerful and easy to learn language. The Software framework, called .NET, is the environment for
executing .NET programs. It includes the Framework Class Library (FCL) which provides provides language interoperability
i.e. each language can use code written in another language. The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the other building block 
of the framework. The CLR deals with security, memory management, execution of applications etc. The FCL and CLR together
form the .NET Framework.
